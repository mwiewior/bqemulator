"""Integration tests for BigQuery's CREATE TABLE (schema) AS SELECT combined syntax.

Pins the end-to-end behaviour landed by
:mod:`bqemulator.sql.rewriter.create_table_schema_ctas`: BigQuery's
canonical combined ``CREATE [OR REPLACE] TABLE x (schema) AS SELECT …``
syntax — which DuckDB's parser rejects natively — now executes
through the emulator, producing a table with the declared column
types and the data from the SELECT.

Discovered 2026-05-17 during P2.d Phase 8 conformance recording; the
P2.d fixtures were initially authored in this canonical BQ form and
all 20 failed at DuckDB parse time, motivating the rewriter.
