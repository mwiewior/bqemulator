"""Pre-translator: ``CREATE TABLE x (schema) AS SELECT …`` → bare CTAS with CAST projections.

BigQuery accepts a single statement that declares an explicit column
schema **and** populates the table from a ``SELECT``::

    CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `p.ds.t` (id INT64, country STRING) AS
    SELECT 1 AS id, 'US' AS country;

DuckDB's parser does not — it accepts ``CREATE TABLE x (schema)`` *or*
``CREATE TABLE x AS SELECT …`` but not both, and rejects the combined
form with ``Parser Error: syntax error at or near "AS"``. SQLGlot's
BigQuery → DuckDB transpile preserves the combined form verbatim, so
the parser error surfaces at DuckDB execution time.

The rewriter strips the schema clause and wraps each ``SELECT``
projection in ``CAST(<value> AS <declared-type>) AS <declared-name>``.
The resulting bare CTAS produces a table with exactly the column
names and types the user declared in the schema clause, even when the
``SELECT`` literal would otherwise infer a wider or narrower type
(``SELECT 1`` infers ``INT64`` but ``CAST(1 AS NUMERIC)`` lands as
``NUMERIC``, matching BigQuery's behaviour).

The alternative shape — emit two statements (``CREATE TABLE x
(schema)`` then ``INSERT INTO x SELECT …``) — was rejected because
the rewriter would have to know how to insert two statements into a
caller that expects exactly one (the executor + scripting interpreter
both assume one statement per ``query.sql``). The cast-and-elide form
preserves single-statement semantics and is therefore safe inside
``BEGIN TRANSACTION`` blocks and procedural scripts.

Column-count mismatch — fewer schema columns than ``SELECT``
projections, or vice versa — is intentionally left alone. SQLGlot's
transpile will still hand the original combined form to DuckDB and
the user will see the same DuckDB parser error they saw before, which
is no worse than the pre-rewriter behaviour. Matching BQ's exact
wording for the "column count" / "type mismatch" / "duplicate column"
shapes is outside the scope of this rewriter; the bare CTAS path
surfaces those errors via the standard pipeline.
